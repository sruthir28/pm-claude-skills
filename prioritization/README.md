# PM Prioritization Framework

Stop debating priorities. Use proven frameworks to make data-driven decisions in minutes, not hours.

## What This Skill Does

Helps you prioritize features, initiatives, and tasks using 4 proven PM frameworks:

1. **RICE Scoring** - Quantitative, objective ranking
2. **Impact/Effort Matrix** - Visual 2×2 for quick decisions
3. **Value vs. Complexity** - For technical trade-offs
4. **Weighted Scoring** - Custom criteria for your context

## Why Use This

- ✅ Applies frameworks consistently every time
- ✅ Works with whatever data you have (or don't have)
- ✅ Helps estimate when you lack data - Claude provides baseline ranges based on industry patterns
- ✅ Outputs clean tables you can share with stakeholders
- ✅ Explains when to use which framework
- ✅ Saves hours of debate and analysis paralysis

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use in Claude.ai
1. Copy the [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) content
2. Add to your Claude Project or conversation
3. Say: "Use the prioritization skill to rank these features..."

### Option 2: Reference the Framework
Just mention the framework you want:
```
"Score these with RICE"
"Give me an Impact/Effort matrix for these items"
```

## Example Usage

**Input:**
```
Prioritize these 5 features using RICE:
1. Slack integration
2. Dark mode
3. Mobile app
4. API documentation
5. Custom dashboards

Context: B2B SaaS, 8K users, 4 engineers
```

**Output:**
Clean table with scores, rankings, and recommendations.

## When to Use Each Framework

| Your Situation | Use This Framework |
